1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.400
Not y'all can sell it City all over
United and they score.

2
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.500
It's an own goal by Harry Bailey City
since the first blast of the whistle

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.500
have just been in complete control of
this match.

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000
And at last, they have a gold that
their players merited and it's an

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.900
own goal by Eric by the flag stays
down till phones.

6
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.100
In acres of space.

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.000
Je-sus is come towards him, too.

8
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:39.900
and now Jesu, so, How did that stay
out Jay-Z's thought he'd scored.

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.500
It's a brilliant save.

10
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.700
My teachers can't get out of their
own box.

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.300
At the moment.

12
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.700
To brine are great.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.800
Save again, to hey, is keeping United
in this game.

14
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.100
John can sell.

15
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.200
Oh, it's a cheesing ball.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.900
Oh, it's gone in, but not a silver.

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.700
Didn't seem possible, but he somehow
squeeze it in and right on halftime

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.800
at last City.

19
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.600
Have the second goal that their
domination of this game is deserved

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.100
Bernardo silver honoured, has he even
keep this in Play?

21
00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.700
Nevermind, score and City are two up
in the Darby.

22
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.200
Ciao, ciao.

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.700
Bye Jay.

24
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.900
Zeus and on it goes to the broiler
and gundo Aunt in space and

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300
phone-ins further over.

26
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.600
He's clipped a post.

27
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.800
Well, it's been so one-sided, 10
years ago, City be United 61 here.

28
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.900
It's not going to be 6, but it's been
a complete and total embarrassment.

29
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.600
United outclassed outplayed and be
eaten by the blues again.
